Welcome to Electioneering, your home for comparing the official views of major political figures in the United States. Electioneering, by definition, means the process of actively engaging in an election. Our team encourages you to do just that, with the aid of our cloud-clearing, dirt-sifting service that will let you get to the heart of political issues and the people behind them.

This app and website will allow you to directly compare the stances of major politicians on a comprehensive list of issues. Their official views will be quantified and directly compared to each other, such that you will be able to both visually (through color designation) and textually see these politicians' differences and similarities.

Electioneering will be able to take any two candidates or incumbents and compare them to each other. Currently, election hubs can provide you with data on politicians, but the information is always either subjective or incomplete. Electioneering is neither. Did you ever want to see how Mitt Romney and Michelle Bachmann line up, or Chris Christie and Marco Rubio, or Harry Reid and Paul Ryan? Here's your chance. Electioneering will enable you to choose any two politicians from a fully complete list of all state governors, US Representatives, US Senators, the US President, and presidential candidates.

You can download our app and visit our website at www.electioneering.us to access Electioneering.
